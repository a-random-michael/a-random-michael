## Hi there 👋
I'm Michael, a computer and electronics enthusiast, with experiences ranging from hardware design to web development, electronics and Arduino.

 _Bachelor’s degree in Information And Communication Technology Engineering, (Computer and Electronic System engineering)._

## Currently learning ✏️
- front-end development with nextjs on top of previous experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Currently working on ✨
- chiselStarter: simple bash script to initiate chisel projects.
- a Python script to convert RISC-V pseudo instructions to the equivalent real instruction.
- an egg incubator using arduino able to perform complex temperature control curves, with IoT potential.

## Previous projects 🎈
- [**learn asap**](https://github.com/a-random-michael/learn-asap) : a website built as a collage course project, built in pure PHP and BootStrap, with MariaDB on a Linux host (LAMP stack).
- **logic gates VLSI design** : built the basic logic gates using _sky water pdk_ in _maigc_ and simulated with _spice_.
- **IoT lights**: smart light built with esp8266.
- **RISC-V core** : built a simple RISC-V core using _TL-verilog_ on _MakerChip_ platform.
- **RISC-V SoC** : using pre-built component, generated a RISC-V SoC in _chipyard_ using chisel language (scala).

## Tools 🛠️
some tools I love & use:
- Python and its many libraries such as Django.
- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).
- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) as the main os and [nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager.
- [kde plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) as a desktop environment.
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) as the text editor and IDE.
